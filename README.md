# BMICalculator
This iOS app, developed by me, calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from user-provided weight and height. It supports both metric and imperial units. The app interprets the BMI value according to health categories like Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese, providing users with a meaningful understanding of their health status.
